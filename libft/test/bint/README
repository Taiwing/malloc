Use 'genmake -n bint_test -sn ../.. libft.a' to generate Makefile.

Run ./bint_test to launch automatic tests.
Run ./bint_test blabla to launch automatic tests with detailed output.
Run ./bint_test bc to get interactive big ints calculator.

The python scripts are used to generate tests for modops. In case they are
used, do not forget to change the stop values in main.c or the size of the
arrays in the headers if need be.

The modexp tests are quick enough for use in ft_ssl up to 1024 bits if the
libft and bint_test are compiled with -O3 (so do not forget to set the flag
when pushing the repo).
