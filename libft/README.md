# libft

My full personal library in C, with get_next_line, ft_printf and ft_getopt
included.

## Directory structure

The includes and src directories are where the C headers and source files are
stored.

### test

The test directory holds test programs for some libft functions. For
example the test/bint project is a big ints calculator to test the
bint library. It also has automated tests.

### feat

The feat directory is used to develop and test new libft features before
integrating them. This is useful for big experimental features that
require heavy work.

### resources

This is used to store libft related resources. It can be anything (like images,
text files, sounds, 3D files...) as long as it is needed.
