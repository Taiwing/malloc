---- TODO ----

- adapt every libft functions that need it to the new ft_errno system

---- MAYBE ----

- The scan filter is set twice at start since it is initialized in the scan
  setup function. Decide if we really want to set it here instead. This not
  really the most efficient way. It would be better to set it only once, but
  then incoming packets should not be filtered by sequence (which is not a
  problem, it can be done after but it requires updating the filters...).
  (for context, this is referring to the ft_scan_set_filter() call in the
  'src/net/ft_scan_send.c' file)

- Rework scans to remove unused functions and make adventure mode possible

---- FEAT ----

- adventure mode (for net scans)

- when genmake will be able to handle more than one level depth sources, move
  sources of get_next_line, ft_printf and ft_getopt into different directories
  in src and in includes
