# malloc

Implementation of the *malloc* function in C. This function dynamically
allocates memory for C programs. The *free* function is also provided as well as
*realloc* which changes the size of previous memory allocation, and
*show_alloc_mem* which displays information about the state of the allocated
memory zones.
